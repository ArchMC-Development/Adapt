# Adapt

_Adapt is a drag and drop solution for balanced passive abilities and skills that players can enjoy on a server._

Adapt Abilities are all accessible in the in-game GUI (Right-clicking any Bookshelf **_Face_**) providing a more user-friendly experience to a "skills" system. Most servers want to increase the quality of the "vanilla" experience. Most Skill based plugins are about powers, game breaking systems, and riddles with bugs. That's where Adapt comes in.  Lightweight on the server, and providing mere quality of life enhancements to a user's experience. Below is a **WIP** List of features (_and descriptions_) that ill fill when i can.
