# Adapt

_Adapt is a drag and drop solution for balanced passive abilities and skills that players can enjoy on a server. Everything is done with a comprehensive ui setup ingame (Right click a bookshelf) and individual configuration purely in JSON configuration in the plugins folder_ 

Adapt Abilities are all accessable in the ingame GUI (Right clicking any Bookshelf **_Face_**) by providing a more user friendly experience to a "skills" system. Most servers want to increase the quality of the "vanilla" experience but all those plugins are about powers, game breaking systems, and riddles with bugs! Adapt is designed to be the drag and drop solution for that.  Lightweight on the server, and providing mere quality of life enhancements to a user's experience.
